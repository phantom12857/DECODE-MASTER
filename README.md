# DECODE-MASTER

No direct pushes to `main`. Ever.

## Rules
- Use personal branches.
- If you feel the dire, uncontrollable need to push to main, Either text me, (609)-433-3373, open a PR and ping **@Kerboom4826**, or use slack and message in #coding, or DM me.
- Feel free to ruin any other REPO you want, I really dont care.
  

## Consequences
If you do push to main without approval, I will be immediatly reverting to pre-push, and then explaining to you in **VERY** simple terms that if you do it again, I will **PERSONALLY** remove your access to this REPO, and then break all electronic devices you own into 17 peices each, and mail each individual peice to seperate third world contries. :)

Thanks for cooperating :/
