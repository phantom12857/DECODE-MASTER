     * Indicates that a new ciphering or integrity algorithm was used for a particular voice,

     * concerns, once a ConnectionEvent has been reported on, follow-up reports about that

     * SecurityAlgorithmUpdate#isUnprotectedEmergency changes. A change only in cell ID should not
     * trigger an update, as the design is intended to be agnostic to dual connectivity ("secondary
     * serving cells").
     * 
     * Example to further clarify "most-recently reported":
     * 1. After booting up, the UE is in ENDC with LTE. Modem reports NAS_SIGNALLING_LTE and
     *    AS_SIGNALLING_LTE are well-ciphered but AS_SIGNALLING_5G is null-ciphered.
     * 2. UE moves to 3G and enters the connected mode. Modem reports indications of PS_SERVICE_3G
     *    and SIGNALLING_3G to Android.
     * 3. UE moves to LTE. UE enters the connected mode and there is no ENDC. The algorithms of
     *    NAS_SIGNALLING_LTE and AS_SIGNALLING_LTE are the same as in Step 1. The UE should send
     *    this indication to AP as it’s a RAT switch.
     * 4. Later, UE establishes ENDC. AS_SIGNALLING_5G is null-ciphered. The UE should send this
     *    indication as well, as it is a RAT switch.
     * 5. The UE enter IDLE mode, and later connected mode in ENDC. There are no changes to security
     *    algorithms, so the modem does not need to send any updates.
     * 
     * Most recently reported state is reset when (1) RadioState is transitioned to ON from any
     * other state (e.g. radio is turned on during device boot, or modem boot), and (2) when
     * CardState is transitioned to PRESENT from any other state (e.g. when SIM is inserted), or (3)
     * if there is a change in access network (PLMN) or RAT.
     * 
     * securityAlgorithmUpdate indications must be sent to Android regardless of the screen state.
     * If the screen is off, the indications must still be sent to Android.

     * 
     * 5G TS 38.331 cipheringDisabled and integrityProtection
     * ======================================================
     * For most connections, generally what is reported by the network is what ends up being used.
     * There are two significant cases where this may not be the case. In 5G, per the introduction
     * of network configuration options cipheringDisabled and integrityProtection (TS 38.331), the
     * network can have declared certain security algorithms to be used while also requiring a null
     * algorithm via those parameters.
     * 
     * 
     * Exceptions for DRBs with null integrity (pre-5G Rel 16)
     * =======================================================
     * When reporting the SecurityAlgorithm for a ConnectionType which includes a DRB, there is an
     * exception where a DRB with null integrity is not to be considered/included in reporting
     * except for 5G Rel 16 connections and newer. Because DRBs almost always use null integrity in
     * practice, and thus if included the report would always be null, rendering the report
     * useless. For anything 5G Rel 16 or newer, accurate reporting for the DRB's integrity is
     * required.
     * 
     * 
     * NRDC MCG and SCGs
     * =================
     * In the NRDC case, there can be two sets of algorithms, one for the MCG (Master Cell Group)
     * and one for the SCG (Secondary Cell Group). In this case, always send a combined update that
     * reflects the weaker of the algorithms, e.g. (weakest) NEA0 < NEA1 < NEA2 < NEA3 (strongest).
     * This applies to both the ciphering and integrity algorithms.
     * 
     * 
     * Determining the value of isUnprotectedEmergency
     * ===============================================
     * 2G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
     * 3G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering and integrity algorithm are NULL.
     * 4G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
     * 5G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
     * Notes:
     *    - On integrity: In 4G, PDCP can be LTE-based or NR-based. Starting from 5G Rel 17, only
     *      the NR-based PDCP supports DRB integrity. As the PDCP version can change during a DRB's
     *      operation, it becomes complicated when integrity is used to determine whether an
     *      emergency call is protected or not, hence its exclusion to simplify implementation.
     *    - 4G and 5G with multiple DRBs : emergency calls are protected under that RAT only if all
     *      SRBs and DRBs are protected (including IMS DRB).
     *    - 4G and 5G DRB integrity: Since DRB integrity is not enabled in most networks, if both
     *      ciphering and integrity are taken into account to determine the value of
     *      isUnprotectedEmergency, the value will mostly be false, hence why it is excluded.

       * trigger an update, as the design is intended to be agnostic to dual connectivity ("secondary
       * serving cells").
       * 
       * Example to further clarify "most-recently reported":
       * 1. After booting up, the UE is in ENDC with LTE. Modem reports NAS_SIGNALLING_LTE and
       *    AS_SIGNALLING_LTE are well-ciphered but AS_SIGNALLING_5G is null-ciphered.
       * 2. UE moves to 3G and enters the connected mode. Modem reports indications of PS_SERVICE_3G
       *    and SIGNALLING_3G to Android.
       * 3. UE moves to LTE. UE enters the connected mode and there is no ENDC. The algorithms of
       *    NAS_SIGNALLING_LTE and AS_SIGNALLING_LTE are the same as in Step 1. The UE should send
       *    this indication to AP as it’s a RAT switch.
       * 4. Later, UE establishes ENDC. AS_SIGNALLING_5G is null-ciphered. The UE should send this
       *    indication as well, as it is a RAT switch.
       * 5. The UE enter IDLE mode, and later connected mode in ENDC. There are no changes to security
       *    algorithms, so the modem does not need to send any updates.
       * 
       * Most recently reported state is reset when (1) RadioState is transitioned to ON from any
       * other state (e.g. radio is turned on during device boot, or modem boot), and (2) when
       * CardState is transitioned to PRESENT from any other state (e.g. when SIM is inserted), or (3)
       * if there is a change in access network (PLMN) or RAT.
       * 
       * securityAlgorithmUpdate indications must be sent to Android regardless of the screen state.
       * If the screen is off, the indications must still be sent to Android.

       * 
       * 5G TS 38.331 cipheringDisabled and integrityProtection
       * ======================================================
       * For most connections, generally what is reported by the network is what ends up being used.
       * There are two significant cases where this may not be the case. In 5G, per the introduction
       * of network configuration options cipheringDisabled and integrityProtection (TS 38.331), the
       * network can have declared certain security algorithms to be used while also requiring a null
       * algorithm via those parameters.
       * 
       * 
       * Exceptions for DRBs with null integrity (pre-5G Rel 16)
       * =======================================================
       * When reporting the SecurityAlgorithm for a ConnectionType which includes a DRB, there is an
       * exception where a DRB with null integrity is not to be considered/included in reporting
       * except for 5G Rel 16 connections and newer. Because DRBs almost always use null integrity in
       * practice, and thus if included the report would always be null, rendering the report
       * useless. For anything 5G Rel 16 or newer, accurate reporting for the DRB's integrity is
       * required.
       * 
       * 
       * NRDC MCG and SCGs
       * =================
       * In the NRDC case, there can be two sets of algorithms, one for the MCG (Master Cell Group)
       * and one for the SCG (Secondary Cell Group). In this case, always send a combined update that
       * reflects the weaker of the algorithms, e.g. (weakest) NEA0 < NEA1 < NEA2 < NEA3 (strongest).
       * This applies to both the ciphering and integrity algorithms.
       * 
       * 
       * Determining the value of isUnprotectedEmergency
       * ===============================================
       * 2G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
       * 3G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering and integrity algorithm are NULL.
       * 4G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
       * 5G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
       * Notes:
       *    - On integrity: In 4G, PDCP can be LTE-based or NR-based. Starting from 5G Rel 17, only
       *      the NR-based PDCP supports DRB integrity. As the PDCP version can change during a DRB's
       *      operation, it becomes complicated when integrity is used to determine whether an
       *      emergency call is protected or not, hence its exclusion to simplify implementation.
       *    - 4G and 5G with multiple DRBs : emergency calls are protected under that RAT only if all
       *      SRBs and DRBs are protected (including IMS DRB).
       *    - 4G and 5G DRB integrity: Since DRB integrity is not enabled in most networks, if both
       *      ciphering and integrity are taken into account to determine the value of
       *      isUnprotectedEmergency, the value will mostly be false, hence why it is excluded.

   * signaling, or data connection for a given PLMN and/or access network. Due to power
   * concerns, once a ConnectionEvent has been reported on, follow-up reports about that
   * ConnectionEvent are only generated if there is any change to the most-recently reported
   * encryption or integrity, if there is a RAT change, or if the value of
   * SecurityAlgorithmUpdate#isUnprotectedEmergency changes. A change only in cell ID should not
   * trigger an update, as the design is intended to be agnostic to dual connectivity ("secondary
   * serving cells").
   * 
   * Example to further clarify "most-recently reported":
   * 1. After booting up, the UE is in ENDC with LTE. Modem reports NAS_SIGNALLING_LTE and
   *    AS_SIGNALLING_LTE are well-ciphered but AS_SIGNALLING_5G is null-ciphered.
   * 2. UE moves to 3G and enters the connected mode. Modem reports indications of PS_SERVICE_3G
   *    and SIGNALLING_3G to Android.
   * 3. UE moves to LTE. UE enters the connected mode and there is no ENDC. The algorithms of
   *    NAS_SIGNALLING_LTE and AS_SIGNALLING_LTE are the same as in Step 1. The UE should send
   *    this indication to AP as it’s a RAT switch.
   * 4. Later, UE establishes ENDC. AS_SIGNALLING_5G is null-ciphered. The UE should send this
   *    indication as well, as it is a RAT switch.
   * 5. The UE enter IDLE mode, and later connected mode in ENDC. There are no changes to security
   *    algorithms, so the modem does not need to send any updates.
   * 
   * Most recently reported state is reset when (1) RadioState is transitioned to ON from any
   * other state (e.g. radio is turned on during device boot, or modem boot), and (2) when
   * CardState is transitioned to PRESENT from any other state (e.g. when SIM is inserted), or (3)
   * if there is a change in access network (PLMN) or RAT.
   * 
   * securityAlgorithmUpdate indications must be sent to Android regardless of the screen state.
   * If the screen is off, the indications must still be sent to Android.

   * 5G TS 38.331 cipheringDisabled and integrityProtection
   * ======================================================
   * For most connections, generally what is reported by the network is what ends up being used.
   * There are two significant cases where this may not be the case. In 5G, per the introduction
   * of network configuration options cipheringDisabled and integrityProtection (TS 38.331), the
   * network can have declared certain security algorithms to be used while also requiring a null
   * algorithm via those parameters.
   * 
   * 
   * Exceptions for DRBs with null integrity (pre-5G Rel 16)
   * =======================================================
   * When reporting the SecurityAlgorithm for a ConnectionType which includes a DRB, there is an
   * exception where a DRB with null integrity is not to be considered/included in reporting
   * except for 5G Rel 16 connections and newer. Because DRBs almost always use null integrity in
   * practice, and thus if included the report would always be null, rendering the report
   * useless. For anything 5G Rel 16 or newer, accurate reporting for the DRB's integrity is
   * required.
   * 
   * 
   * NRDC MCG and SCGs
   * =================
   * In the NRDC case, there can be two sets of algorithms, one for the MCG (Master Cell Group)
   * and one for the SCG (Secondary Cell Group). In this case, always send a combined update that
   * reflects the weaker of the algorithms, e.g. (weakest) NEA0 < NEA1 < NEA2 < NEA3 (strongest).
   * This applies to both the ciphering and integrity algorithms.
   * 
   * 
   * Determining the value of isUnprotectedEmergency
   * ===============================================
   * 2G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
   * 3G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering and integrity algorithm are NULL.
   * 4G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
   * 5G: isUnprotectedEmergency is true if the ciphering algorithm is NULL.
   * Notes:
   *    - On integrity: In 4G, PDCP can be LTE-based or NR-based. Starting from 5G Rel 17, only
   *      the NR-based PDCP supports DRB integrity. As the PDCP version can change during a DRB's
   *      operation, it becomes complicated when integrity is used to determine whether an
   *      emergency call is protected or not, hence its exclusion to simplify implementation.
   *    - 4G and 5G with multiple DRBs : emergency calls are protected under that RAT only if all
   *      SRBs and DRBs are protected (including IMS DRB).
   *    - 4G and 5G DRB integrity: Since DRB integrity is not enabled in most networks, if both
   *      ciphering and integrity are taken into account to determine the value of
   *      isUnprotectedEmergency, the value will mostly be false, hence why it is excluded.
   *
